A SINGLE-PAGE MINIMALIST TO-DO APP

PROJECT OVERVIEW: 
This is a responsive To-Do List application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. It connects to a Mock API to save tasks, meaning your data persists even if you refresh the page.

KEY FEATURES
* Add Tasks: Users can add a title, description, and due date.
* Track Progress: Mark tasks as completed (visual strikethrough).
* Due Date Alerts: The app notifies you when a task is due.
* Visual Indicators: Overdue tasks are highlighted in red.
* Manage Tasks: Delete or update tasks easily.

TECHNOLOGY USED
* Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
* Backend: MockAPI.io (for RESTful API endpoints)

HOW TO RUN LOCALLY
*  Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
* Open the "index.html" file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
* The app will automatically connect to the backend and load any existing tasks.
